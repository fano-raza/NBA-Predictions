# Predicting NBA Games

## Introduction
In this project, I will be using a ML model to try to predict the winners of NBA games in the seasons of 2017/2018 to 2023/2024

To do this, I will be doing the following: 
- Scraping data from webpages **(get_data.ipynb)**
- Parsing and cleaning the data **(parse_data.ipynb)**
- Training and testing a ML model on that data **(prediction.ipynb)**

## Notes
I am using models and functions from the **SciKitLearn** library to run the ML in this project.
